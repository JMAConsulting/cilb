# Amazon SES / SNS Configuration for CiviCRM

Send email using the SES API. Bounce processing is handled via SNS and a webhook that must be
authenticated against the CiviCRM system. This guide will use "example" as a placeholder; replace with your own domain / abbreviation as appropriate.

## Request Production Access

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html on getting access to send email.

## SES Configuration

1. Log in to the AWS console
2. Open SES (using top search bar is easiest)
3. Click **Verified identities**.
4. Create identity:
   - **Identity Type**: Domain
   - **Domain name**: Enter your domain
   - **DKIM**: Easy DKIM and RSA_2048_BIT
   - **DKIM signatures**: Enabled
5. Wait for DKIM verification (can take a few hours).

### DNS Configuration

Add the **three CNAME records** provided by AWS SES.

Add `amazonses.com` to your SPF record. Example:

`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`

Make sure you have a suitable DMARC policy setup for your domain.

## SNS Configuration

Once the system is running on the live domain, now setup bounce and complaint handling via SNS.

### Create SNS Topic

1. Open **Amazon SNS**.
2. Create topic:
   - **Type**: Standard
   - **Name**: domain name (e.g. `example_org`)
   - **Encryption**: Disabled
   - **Access policy**: Default
   - **Delivery retry policy**: Default

### Create SNS Subscription

1. Select the topic you just created.
2. Create subscription:
   - **Protocol**: HTTPS
   - **Endpoint**: https://example.org/civicrm/ses/webhook
   - **Raw message delivery**: Disabled

### Connect SNS to SES

Open SES > Identities and find your domain to configure notifications:
   - **Email feedback forwarding**: Enabled
   - **Bounce feedback**: SNS topic created earlier
   - **Complaint feedback**: SNS topic created earlier
   - **Include original email headers**: Enabled

## CiviCRM SES Extension

Install and configure the CiviCRM SES extension (https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/ses).

1. Login to AWS console and confirm it's the region you want e.g. "us-east-1".
2. Create new IAM user (e.g. `example_civi`)
3. Find / Create group `SES-SendRawEmail` with `AmazonSesSendingAccess` permission added.
4. Create access key and copy key/secret to Administer > CiviMail > Amazon SES.
5. Go to Administer -> System Settings -> Outbound Email, and set it "mail()". Also disable the option to let users to send emails using their own email address, unless you have validated every possible staff email.
6. Go to Administer -> Communications -> FROM Email Addresses, and only enable email addresses that have been validated by SES.
7. Make sure that the "Domain" and "Email" in "Mail Accounts" for "Bounce Processing" account matches one of the verified identities in AWS SES.

Note: If you do not see the permission -> add permission -> create an inline policy for `AmazonSesSendingAccess` group as follows:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ses:SendRawEmail",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## CMS Email Integration

### Wordpress

Install https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/wp-civicrm-mailer

No configuration is required. This will automatically route all email through CiviCRM and no other mailer plugin should be enabled.

### Drupal

- Drupal 8+: https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/civicrmmailer-d8
- Drupal 7: https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/civicrmmailer-d7

## Additional Information

- Amazon's [guide and documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-sns-notifications.html) on how to setup SNS notifications for SES.

### Webhook URL

- WordPress: https://example.org/civicrm/ses/webhook (or https://example.org/?page=CiviCRM&q=civicrm%2fses%2fwebhook if "clean URLs" are not enabled)
- Drupal: https://example.org/civicrm/ses/webhook

The webhook verifies that the _Notification_ or _SubscriptionConfirmation_ it's been originated and sent by the SNS service (as per SNS [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.verify.signature.html)).
